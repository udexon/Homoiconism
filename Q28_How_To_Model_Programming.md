- How do we model programming?

"How to model programming" refers to a technical description outlining the steps and analysis involved when a human programmer attempts to write a program. It is different from the topic ["programming model"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_model) described in Wikipedia.

Despite the long history of computer programming since the launch of [Fortran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran) on IBM 704 in 1957, more than 60 years ago, _modelling programming_ lies at the very core of artificial intelligence, which eluded attempts by many great minds since, as we shall elaborate in this article.

We shall begin to describe modelling programming using a simple example, a Python program to print "Hello":

```
print("Hello")
```

Behind this trivial example are many issues that remain open for decades, such as:
- Why would the programmer want to write this program?
- How do we model the programmer's motivations, including his (her) intention to write this program?

It is beyond the scope of this article to give a comprehensive treatment to the questions above. They however serve as useful introduction. 

In order to define our model of programming, two significant breakthroughs are required:
- homoiconic transformation
- homoiconic token debugging and composition
