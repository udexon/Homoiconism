### From MIT Scratch Programming Language to China's One Belt One Road Program: Addressing Challenges in Global Development from 2020 to 2030 via Educational Innovations in Computer Programming and Mathematics

### #GOQ_Q22
- What are the major challenges for developing countries from 2020 to 2030 and how do we address them?

The Beijing Olympics in 2008 and subsequent world class achievements by China would be regarded as the clearest signs of a new millennium. Consequently, these boosted confidence in the peoples and the governments of many developing countries, further consolidated by China's One Road One Belt Program (OBOR). Android mobile phones, which by default are made in China, and the new 5G services spearheaded by Huawei, have additionally highlighted Chinese talents and expertise in the area of information and communications technologies.

However, as highlighted by various participant nations in the One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative, making sure developing countries are not left behind again in a new round of industrial and technological revolution remains a crucial challenge. The most critical of these challenges would be the drawback in education for computer programming and mathematics, which forms the basis for scientific and engineering advancement.

_As MIT Scratch programming language, a visual, block-based scheme designed to teach programming to children, has received tremendous success in the developed regions in the world, this further contrasted the lagging behind in programming education in developing countries, whose mother tongues are not based on Latin alphabets._

The factors involved in finding solutions for innovations in programming languages involving non-Latin alphabets concern some very fundamental theories in software engineering and mathematics, which are in a very small niche in computer science, yet actually affects the majority of the world population, i.e. those whose mother tongues are not Latin alphabets.

It is rather ironic that the non-Latin programming language problem has lingered on for over half a century without viable solutions, starting from FORTRAN, the first human readable programming language to be run on the first commercial computers, the IBM 704 mainframe. It is also ironic that, China, Japan and Korea, despite their successes in other fields in science and engineering, have not produced viable solutions for this problem. This further illustrates the complications involved in finding the solutions for non-Latin human natural languages.

As such, the solution we propose in this project, the Phos programming language, an extension of the Forth programming language, has tremenduous significance due to the factors described above.


### #GOQ_Q23
- What is the Phos programming languageï¼Ÿ

Phos is a stack based programming language syntactically compatible to Forth, implemented as a stack machine shell (smashlet) within a high level host programming language, such as Java, JavaScript, PHP etc., enabling a supply chain model for programming languages, i.e. the host programming language as upstream module, Phos as downstream module.


### #GOQ_Q24
- How does the Phos programming language address the challenges of non-Latin programming languages?

In Forth and Phos, there is an alias mechanism called "colon definition", where a new word (function name) can be used as an alias to another word (function name) or a sequence of words (word list, sequence of functions). This facility is usually not available in most high level programming languages. As such, Unicode characters or string can be used as Phos words (function name), while retaining the original definition in Latin. Consequently, multiple colon definition words in multiple human natural languages can be used in parallel, thus helping non-Latin programmers to implement word set (function libraries) in their own mother tongue, without losing functionalities in the original Latin colon definition words.

### #GOQ_Q25
- How do social media affect public policy decision making?

It is getting much harder for policy makers in smaller countries to make the right decisions, as social media noises now dominate political agenda. Taiwan and Malaysia are two typical examples worth studying. Topics cocerning technology nowadays are dominated by Apple. Anything that is not related to Apple and Apple products will not get noticed outside technology communities. While superpower like China has a properly set up military ecosystem to identify technologies required to survive, Taiwan and Malaysia are typical examples where decision making have been dominated by national ideologies, i.e. Taiwan independence and Malay dominance. 

For example, while Malaysia has finally sold its first national car company Proton to BYD of China in order to rescue it from bankruptcy, what could have been a flagship collaboration project leading Malaysia forward in the technology and industry sectors has become completely silent, as anything Chinese will be seen as humiliation to Malays, the dominant race whose competitiveness have been questioned even by the Malays themselves.

As such, decisions concerning innovations in education will invariably be affected by factors mentioned above.

However, the decade from 2020 to 2030 will perhaps be the most critical ever in human history, as we expect AGI, artificial general intelligence, to emerge. _Our greatest fear concerning the technological singularity (TS) brought about by AGI is not about man vs. machine, but_ ___ethnic genocide___, as this is still the most potent force of destruction within human society as of 2019, although largely muted.

In the next section, we shall address the issues concerning the teaching and learning of programming languages before exploring a unique property in Phos that may lead directly to artificial general intelligence -- homoiconicity.

Muslim countries are the most insular to foreign influences needed for education reform: compare Malaysia universities with Singapore.
