### From MIT Scratch Programming Language to China's One Belt One Road Program: Addressing Challenges in Global Development from 2020 to 2030 via Educational Innovations in Computer Programming and Mathematics

### #GOQ_Q23
- What are the major challenges for developing countries from 2020 to 2030 and how do we address them?

The Beijing Olympics in 2008 and subsequent world class achievements by China would be regarded as the clearest signs of a new millennium. Consequently, these boosted confidence in the peoples and the governments of many developing countries, further consolidated by China's One Road One Belt Program (OBOR). Android mobile phones, which by default are made in China, and the new 5G services spearheaded by Huawei, have additionally highlighted Chinese talents and expertise in the area of information and communications technologies.

However, as highlighted by various participant nations in the One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative, making sure developing countries are not left behind again in a new round of industrial and technological revolution remains a crucial challenge. The most critical of these challenges would be the drawback in education for computer programming and mathematics, which forms the basis for scientific and engineering advancement.

_As MIT Scratch programming language, a visual, block-based scheme designed to teach programming to children, has received tremendous success in the developed regions in the world, this further contrasted the lagging behind in programming education in developing countries, whose mother tongues are not based on Latin alphabets._

The factors involved in finding solutions for innovations in programming languages involving non-Latin alphabets concern some very fundamental theories in software engineering and mathematics, which are in a very small niche in computer science, yet actually affects the majority of the world population, i.e. those whose mother tongues are not Latin alphabets.

It is rather ironic that the non-Latin programming language problem has lingered on for over half a century without viable solutions, starting from FORTRAN, the first human readable programming language to be run on the first commercial computers, the IBM 704 mainframe. It is also ironic that, China, Japan and Korea, despite their successes in other fields in science and engineering, have not produced viable solutions for this problem. This further illustrates the complications involved in finding the solutions for non-Latin human natural languages.

As such, the solution we propose in this project, the Phos programming language, an extension of the Forth programming language, has tremenduous significance due to the factors described above.

- What is the Phos programming languageï¼Ÿ

Phos is a stack based programming language syntactically compatible to Forth, implemented as a stack machine shell (smashlet) within a high level host programming language, such as Java, JavaScript, PHP etc., enabling a supply chain model for programming languages, i.e. the host programming language as upstream module, Phos as downstream module.
