### From MIT Scratch Programming Language to China's One Belt One Road Program: Addressing Challenges in Global Development from 2020 to 2030 via Educational Innovations in Computer Programming and Mathematics

### #GOQ_Q22
- What are the major challenges for developing countries from 2020 to 2030 and how do we address them?

The Beijing Olympics in 2008 and subsequent world class achievements by China would be regarded as the clearest signs of a new millennium. Consequently, these boosted confidence in the peoples and the governments of many developing countries, further consolidated by China's One Road One Belt Program (OBOR). Android mobile phones, which by default are made in China, and the new 5G services spearheaded by Huawei, have additionally highlighted Chinese talents and expertise in the area of information and communications technologies.

However, as highlighted by various participant nations in the One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative, making sure developing countries are not left behind again in a new round of industrial and technological revolution remains a crucial challenge. The most critical of these challenges would be the drawback in education for computer programming and mathematics, which forms the basis for scientific and engineering advancement.

_As MIT Scratch programming language, a visual, block-based scheme designed to teach programming to children, has received tremendous success in the developed regions in the world, this further contrasted the lagging behind in programming education in developing countries, whose mother tongues are not based on Latin alphabets._

The factors involved in finding solutions for innovations in programming languages involving non-Latin alphabets concern some very fundamental theories in software engineering and mathematics, which are in a very small niche in computer science, yet actually affects the majority of the world population, i.e. those whose mother tongues are not Latin alphabets.

It is rather ironic that the non-Latin programming language problem has lingered on for over half a century without viable solutions, starting from FORTRAN, the first human readable programming language to be run on the first commercial computers, the IBM 704 mainframe. It is also ironic that, China, Japan and Korea, despite their successes in other fields in science and engineering, have not produced viable solutions for this problem. This further illustrates the complications involved in finding the solutions for non-Latin human natural languages.

As such, the solution we propose in this project, the Phos programming language, an extension of the Forth programming language, has tremenduous significance due to the factors described above.


### #GOQ_Q23
- What is the Phos programming languageï¼Ÿ

Phos is a stack based programming language syntactically compatible to Forth, implemented as a stack machine shell (smashlet) within a high level host programming language, such as Java, JavaScript, PHP etc., enabling a supply chain model for programming languages, i.e. the host programming language as upstream module, Phos as downstream module.


### #GOQ_Q24
- How does the Phos programming language address the challenges of non-Latin programming languages?

In Forth and Phos, there is an alias mechanism called "colon definition", where a new word (function name) can be used as an alias to another word (function name) or a sequence of words (word list, sequence of functions). This facility is usually not available in most high level programming languages. As such, Unicode characters or string can be used as Phos words (function name), while retaining the original definition in Latin. Consequently, multiple colon definition words in multiple human natural languages can be used in parallel, thus helping non-Latin programmers to implement word set (function libraries) in their own mother tongue, without losing functionalities in the original Latin colon definition words.

### #GOQ_Q25
- How do social media affect public policy decision making?

It is getting much harder for policy makers in smaller countries to make the right decisions, as social media noises now dominate political agenda. Taiwan and Malaysia are two typical examples worth studying. Topics cocerning technology nowadays are dominated by Apple. Anything that is not related to Apple and Apple products will not get noticed outside technology communities. While superpower like China has a properly set up military ecosystem to identify technologies required to survive, Taiwan and Malaysia are typical examples where decision making have been dominated by national ideologies, i.e. Taiwan independence and Malay dominance. 

For example, while Malaysia has finally sold its first national car company Proton to BYD of China in order to rescue it from bankruptcy, what could have been a flagship collaboration project leading Malaysia forward in the technology and industry sectors has become completely silent, as anything Chinese will be seen as humiliation to Malays, the dominant race whose competitiveness have been questioned even by the Malays themselves.

As such, decisions concerning innovations in education will invariably be affected by factors mentioned above.

However, the decade from 2020 to 2030 will perhaps be the most critical ever in human history, as we expect AGI, artificial general intelligence, to emerge. _Our greatest fear concerning the technological singularity (TS) brought about by AGI is not about man vs. machine, but_ ___ethnic genocide___, as this is still the most potent force of destruction within human society as of 2019, although largely muted.

In the next section, we shall address the issues concerning the teaching and learning of programming languages before exploring a unique property in Phos that may lead directly to artificial general intelligence -- homoiconicity.

### #GOQ_Q26 
- How does Phos overcome the side effects of too many programming languages?

The programming communities are perhaps the most innovative groupings of our age as the IT industry generated perhaps the largest stream of revenues and has shown the fastest growth in recent history. A quick look at Rosetta Code Bubble Sort page shows there are now 137 programming languages for this particular elementary algorithm which every programmer has learned, in one or more programming languages. Of the "fresh and hot" new programming languages, the "big 3", Go, Rust and Haskell are making waves in programmers' forums.

However, few seems to be worried about the side effects of creating too many programming languages, let alone have a solution to overcome them. Perhaps this is just accepted as a natural outcome of ageism in the industry -- the old programmers who are not able to learn new programming languages should be retired; the young programmers will just learn the new programming languages and try to cope.

Against this back drop, MIT and Google have worked on Scratch and Blockly, visual block schemes to help children as well as adults to learn programming without using text.

From the programming languages listed in Rosetta Code to MIT Scratch and Google Blockly, we need a theoretical model to analyze them. However, to find a common theoretical model to analyze ALL known programming languages is like to find the master key to all locks.

Does such a common theoretical model for all programming languages exist?

Conversely, if a common theoretical model for all programming languages can be found, then it will be very significant breakthrough in the field of computer science.

At this point, we will let the readers to decide whether to click on the next link to reveal the secret of all programming languages, leaving the opportunity to find the solution for those who are willing to attempt at it.

, in order to .... this is like finding a master key to all locks .... how to explain?

... homoiconic programming to wider audience 

https://github.com/udexon/Homoiconism

- We coin the term "homoiconism" to refer to the procedures, analyses and related topics where non-homoiconic program code is transformed into homoiconic form, as this subject has not been investigated extensively elsewhere. We believe we have invented a novel, generalized procedure for transforming programs written in ANY known programming language into a Forth like Reverse Polish Notation syntax, known as the Inverse Shunting Yard Algorithm (ISYA), thus making homoiconism accessible to a much wider audience than previously possible.

These problems concern metaprogramming, compiler design, niche. need facility to combine practical applications and easy to learn. Hence smashlet.
