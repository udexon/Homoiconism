### Mastering Computer Programming and Abstract Mathematics One Line At A Time with Phos Stack Machine Shell Language (Smashlet)

Stack Machine Shell Language Engine Terminal (Smashlet)

50 years old CEO can do it. 5 years old kid can do it.--> use this live example!! 

Should write the outcome of Phos, one line of code to learn and share, learn mathematics by one line of code, within first paragraph of article.

Readers have no patience.

Computer programming and abstract mathematics have the same origin. Over the years, specialization has resulted in separation of disciplines, although occasionally we witness cross fertilization of the two fields, especially in computer algebra system.  

We have rediscovered the secret formula linking computer programming and abstract mathematics, which has several very important practical applications:
- enabling learners to learn computer programming AND abstract mathematics using one line of code at a time
- enabling programmers, from novice to experts, to collaborate on complex programs and systems globally, with one line of code at a time.

We call this system Phos -- it is a shell programming language based on stack machine. It is abbreviated as Smashlet -- stack machine shell language engine terminal.

The creation of Phos Smashlet is based on the Forth programming language, a relatively unknown programming language nowadays, launched in 1968 by Charles H. Moore. Although not much is known about the relationships between Charles Moore and Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Intel whose name gave rose to the Moore's law, some fans of Charles Moore believe that Charles's contribution to computing may one day outshine that of Gordon's, as we shall explore in this article.

Instead of calling Forth an artificial creation, some may describe it as a "discovery", much like the discovery of mathematical and physical laws. With Forth, or its extension Phos, we may continue to explore the mysteries of abstract mathematics and computer programming. 

We use the name Phos as it rhymes with Forth, and it means "light" in Greek.
