Homoiconism

Homoiconism refers to the procedures, analyses and related topics where non-homoiconic program code is transformed into homoiconic form. We believe we have invented a novel, generalized procedure for transforming programs written in ***ANY*** _known programming language_ into a Forth like Reverse Polish Notation syntax, thus making homoiconism accessible to a much wider audience than previously possible.

*ANY*
