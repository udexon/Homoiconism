# Homoiconism
Homoiconism

Homoiconism refers to the procedures, analyses and related topics where non-homoiconic program code is transformed into homoiconic form. We believe we have invented a novel, generalized procedure for transforming programs written in ***ANY known programming language*** into a Forth like Reverse Polish Notation syntax, known as the ***Inverse Shunting Yard Algorithm (ISYA)***, thus making homoiconism accessible to a much wider audience than previously possible.

While Wikipedia and the few literature briefly explored some issues concerning homoiconicity, we believe they can be addressed systematically using ISYA.

eval() vs. others??

*ANY*
