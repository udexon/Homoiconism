Imagine millions of students worldwide engage in collaborative Programming for an online game, with virtual reality and robotics, each contributing one line or a few lines of code similar to Turtle Graphics Logo Programming Language.

Although the Logo Programming Language is officially classified as a member of the LISP family, we shall leave it to another discussion to explore the relationships of LISP and Reverse Polish Notation and Stack Machine, from which Forth and Phos are derived. 

Homo in Homogotchi refers to homoiconic programming, the property that a program written in the Phos Programming Language can be processed and modified by another program written in the Phos Programming Language.
