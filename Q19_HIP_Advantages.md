- What are the advantages of homoiconic programming vs. conventional (monolingual) programming?

We will start with a bold answer, a solution to an increasingly critical problem that has no prior solution: Ageism in programming.

Although we may not be able to prove that ageism in the programming profession is an intended consequence of development of novel programming languages, ageism nevertheless exists within the IT industry, and it is a proven tool to cut cost and "stay competitive" as with other industries.

Conventional monolingual programming (CMLP) usually requires the programmer to use and be familiar with the programming language concerned. However, programming languages are usually incomptible with each other. As such, when a major programming language replaces another every five years or so, ageism or age discrimination in the programming profession is more brutal than other industries, which have already matured and and produced more humane organizational transitions. 

To borrow an analogy from supply chain model, homoiconic programming (HIP) provides a common downstream interface, in the form of Forth like Reverse Polish Notation, to the host programming language, which constitutes the upstream modules.

Forth is a unique programming language which celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2018. While the mainstream of the Forth programmers community do not yet consider HIP a priority as it is novel, the compatibility of Phos and Forth will guarantee Phos ability in overcoming ageism in programming, given the long history of Forth.

As homoiconic programming (HIP) consists of upstream (host programming language, e.g. PHP, JavaScript, Java etc.) and downstream (Phos Smashlet), they are targeted at senior programmers (upstream) and junior or novice programmers (downstream). In our humble opinion, this is a first in the history of computing, and will bring many huge benefits.

Overcoming ageism by adding value to RPN with mathematics, for young to old.
