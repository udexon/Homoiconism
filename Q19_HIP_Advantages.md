- What are the advantages of homoiconic programming vs. conventional (monolingual) programming?

We will start with a bold answer, a solution to an increasingly critical problem that has no prior solution: Ageism in programming.

Although we may not be able to prove that ageism in the programming profession is an intended consequence of development of novel programming languages, ageism nevertheless exists within the IT industry, and it is a proven tool to cut cost and "stay competitive" as with other industries.

Conventional monolingual programming (CMLP) usually requires the programmer to use and be familiar with the programming language concerned. However, programming languages are usually incomptible with each other.
