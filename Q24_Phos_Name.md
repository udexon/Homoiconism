The name Phos is a play on religious terms and ancient languages:
- Forth was originally intended to signify the "fourth" generation programming language. Legends have it that the IBM computer used at the time had a 5 character limit on the file name. Hence Forth was named.
- Several Chinese programmers played  important roles in the history of Forth. As they have transliterated Forth as 弗式, a reverse romanization convention adopted before the rise of influence of the People's Republic of China, Phos would use the same Chinese transliteration as Forth. Or simply "new 弗式"  "新弗式".
- Phos is part of the Biblical phrase "genethetho Phos", "fiat lux" in Latin, or "let there be light".
- 弗 and 佛 (Buddha) are phonetic characters which do not have any other meanings in the Chinese language.
- The first movement of the legendary Hong Kong comics Buddha's Palms 如来神掌 is 佛光初现, literally, "let there be light".
