Use difference in logo implementations in Kturtle and Java 8 in Android while Java 11 is out to illistrate divergence in programming languages, need to manage using Phos.

This article is aimed at both novice as well as senior programmers, although such combination is perhaps quite rare. We will discuss the characteristics of Programming Languages that are suitable for beginners. Programming Language developers should be concerned and may contribute to our solutions. 

Choose software based on developers activities. Compare ucblogo and Kturtle.

Use non question title that is generalized from question
